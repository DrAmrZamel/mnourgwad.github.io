Site design
-----------

The design of this site is my own. But I began by taking a careful look
at [David Sanson's site](http://www.davidsanson.com), and the
bones of this site's design continue to owe a fair bit to his.

Nuts and Bolts
--------------

This site is generated by

-   [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (a lightweight CMS)

The site makes use of several useful scripts and services:

-   [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) manages comments.
-   [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) makes adding occasional bits of
    javascript-powered functionality easy
-   [html5shiv](http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/) makes older
    versions of Internet Explorer recognize HTML5 elements.
-   I use the [COinS Generator](http://generator.ocoins.info/) to
    generate COinS metadata for papers on my research page.

The site is hosted on

-   [github](https://github.com/mnourgwad/mnourgwad.github.io/),

an inexpensive pay-as-you-go bare-bones reputable web host. I end up
paying \~$9 a year for domain registration and \>50Â¢ a month for storage
and bandwidth. I've been happy with them so far. To keep that price low,
large files (like PDFs) are hosted via

-   [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/)

To make the Dropbox URLs look better, I use

-   [Dropbprox](http://code.google.com/p/dropbprox/)
